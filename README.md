#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Thorough testing is a method to make code or software is function. There are different methods we 
can use against data to make sure the sturcture of our code is doing whats intended, or the behavior of the program is correct. 

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Gathering all the information on expected behavior by the user and then do research to make sure it's feasible would be steps to incorporate needs into the program. 


#How do I approach designing software?

Designing software involves breaking down the software into seperate parts. 
Each part would also involve determining the flow of the how the components interact with each other or isolated.
Designing software would include thinking about test cases before actually building the software to avoid having to redesign any behavior thats faulty. 
Tests are then done on top of the program being built.
